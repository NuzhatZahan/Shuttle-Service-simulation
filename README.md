# Shuttle-Service-simulation
Shuttle service is a bus service that transport users to go the university with free of cost. Sometime students wait a long time or sometime bus run empty. So our project 
try to solve this problem, We create a simulator which show all possible probability for better services. To solve this problem we use some assumptions like: 1)Fixed class slot.
2) Shuttle wait until full its capacity. 3) There is only 1 Shuttle and 4)There is no internal time loss.
Here I am attaching project description slide as well as project demonstration video for better understandings.
